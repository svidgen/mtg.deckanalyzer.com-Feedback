# [mtg.deckanalyzer.com](http://mtg.deckanalyzer.com/) Feedback
This is a public space to provide feedback for mtg.deckanalyzer.com.

The development team will monitor the [**bugs** and **feature requests**](https://github.com/svidgen/mtg.deckanalyzer.com-Feedback/issues) reported here and routinely work on the most active issues.

### Please report new bugs and great ideas!

Throw your support behind issues you think are important by [giving a thumbs up](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). And add an issue for anything that's not on the list. But, try to avoid adding duplicates that will fragment feedback and ativity. *Remember,* we prioritize issues primarily by the number of [+1's](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments) they receive.

## *Ready!?* ... Give us your feedback [*HERE*](https://github.com/svidgen/mtg.deckanalyzer.com-Feedback/issues).

***Thanks!***
