# [mtg.deckanalyzer.com](http://mtg.deckanalyzer.com/) Feedback
This is a public space to provide feedback for mtg.deckanalyzer.com.

The development team will monitor the [**bugs** and **feature requests**](https://github.com/svidgen/mtg.deckanalyzer.com-Feedback/issues) reported here and routinely work on the most active issues.

### Please report new bugs and great ideas!

Throw your support behind issues you think are important commenting or [giving a üëç](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). And add an issue for anything that's not on the list. But, try to avoid adding duplicates that will fragment feedback and ativity. We consider the number of comments and üëç's on issues when we decide what to do next.

## *Ready!?* ... Give us your feedback [*HERE*](https://github.com/svidgen/mtg.deckanalyzer.com-Feedback/issues).

**Thanks!**

### Additional Details

Here are the public lists we'll be working with:

* [In Progress](https://github.com/svidgen/mtg.deckanalyzer.com-Feedback/issues/assigned/*) :  Issues that we're already working on.
* [Most Upvoted Unassigned](https://github.com/svidgen/mtg.deckanalyzer.com-Feedback/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Aassignee+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) : Issues sorted by üëç's. Issues with many votes are likely to be accepted. And those with meaningful, helpful comments are likely to get a little priority boost.
* [New Issues](https://github.com/svidgen/mtg.deckanalyzer.com-Feedback/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Aassignee+sort%3Acreated-desc) : We'll occasionally check this for emergent, *serious* problems that need to jump that line.

Note that we also have an internal queue for sensitive, critical, and "boring" issues.
